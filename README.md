# Relert
### A relatively simple bot that alerts you when your phrase is detected on a certain subreddit post
It's essentially as simple as it sounds. You give it a subreddit to watch, a phrase to monitor, and a discord webhook and it'll alert you if your phrase is found in the title of any post.


## FAQ

### -Why?
I'm getting tired of missing decent deals on r/homelabsales and r/hardwareswap. Also, I like using PRAW!

### -Can't you just use one of the many reddit bots that already exist?
Of course but that would be smart and efficient, which we don't do here.

### -Is this gonna become a full-fledged program?
Probably not. At most there's gonna be a config that takes your reddit token and whatnot, but I think the rest of the parameters will be supplied as command line options to the program.
